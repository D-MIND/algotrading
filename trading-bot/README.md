# Cryptocurrency Trading Bot

This bot is a work-in-progress and development can be followed on the Cryptocurrency Trading YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/cryptocurrencytrading

Part 1 and Part 2 are included in this project for future viewers of those videos, but Part 3 is where active development is happening.

Currently, only backtesting using the Poloniex API is supported, but plans for other exchanges and live trading are planned.

Backtesting can be run using the following command on Part 3:
`python backtest.py`

Examples:
- trading-bot-part-2: python2 trading-bot-part-2.py -p 300 -c BTC_XMR -n 15 -s 1491048000 -e 1491091200
